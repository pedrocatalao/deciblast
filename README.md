# Deciblast

A very simple audio spectrum visualiser made with Python.

### Features
* Auto adjusts to terminal/pane size
* Audio gain auto adjusts to current ambient noise to keep the bars alive. (when in silence it is more sensitive)
* Various color gradients
* Various bar styles
* Configurable bar spacing
* Various frame colors
* Frame on/off
* Labels on/off
* Current config is automatically saved and next time it will look the same.

How it looks on a full screen terminal:
